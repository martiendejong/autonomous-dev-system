## Issue: TikTok API Configuration Error

**Problem:** TikTok Developer Portal requires publicly accessible, HTTPS, non-redirecting pages for:
- Terms of Service URL
- Privacy Policy URL

Current URLs (https://app.brand2boost.com/) fail because:
- Root URLs dont contain ToS/Privacy content
- May require login (not publicly accessible)
- TikTok cannot verify URL properties

## Solution - 4 Steps Required

### Step 1: Create Public Legal Document Pages (NEEDS DEVELOPMENT)
Create two static pages that do NOT require login:
- https://brand2boost.com/terms OR https://app.brand2boost.com/terms
- https://brand2boost.com/privacy OR https://app.brand2boost.com/privacy

Requirements:
- HTTPS
- No login required
- Loads directly in browser
- Contains relevant legal text
- Not blank, not redirecting

### Step 2: Add Legal Content (NEEDS CONTENT)

Terms of Service must include:
- Service eligibility
- Account usage rules
- Copyright policy
- Limitations of liability
- Contact info

Privacy Policy must include:
- Data collected
- Purpose of processing
- Cookies usage
- Third-party sharing
- User rights
- Contact info

### Step 3: Update TikTok Developer Portal Config
Set URLs in TikTok Developer Portal:
- Terms of Service URL: https://brand2boost.com/terms
- Privacy Policy URL: https://brand2boost.com/privacy

### Step 4: Verify URL Properties
TikTok checks:
- HTTP 200 response (not 302, 401, 403, 404)
- Public access (no login redirect)
- TLS certificate validity
- Page not empty

Test command: curl -I https://brand2boost.com/terms
Expected: HTTP/2 200
