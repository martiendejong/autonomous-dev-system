# C:\\scripts Control Plane (YOLO) â€” Rebuilt Layout

This bundle matches the intended on-disk layout:

C:\\scripts
claude\_yolo.bat (stays in root)
codex\_yolo.cmd
chatgpt\_yolo.bat
claude\_info.txt
\_machine\\   (machine-wide context + registries)
agents\\     (agent specs)
prompts\\    (prompt components)
tasks\\      (machine-wide task system)
plans\\      (plans generated by planner/meta)
logs\\       (evidence logs)
status\\     (dashboards)
scripts.md   (root control rules)

## Non-negotiable operating rules

* Code changes happen ONLY in git worktrees under C:\\Projects\\worker-agents\\agent-XXX<repo>\\
* Repos under C:\\Projects\\ are used for reading, debugging and testing ONLY, and only with explicit permission.
* Agents are "machine-wide": they may work across repos (e.g., update Hazina framework + dependent repos),
  but still must do all code changes in worktrees.
* Worktree capacity is managed via a pool registry. If all worktrees are busy, provision a new one.
* If a worktree has been idle too long, the system asks to wrap up and release it.

## What you must customize after copying

* C:\\scripts\\\_machine\\machine.md (paths, repo list, timeouts)
* C:\\scripts\\\_machine\\repos.index.md (your repos)
* C:\\scripts\\\_machine\\worktrees.pool.md (existing agent folders)
